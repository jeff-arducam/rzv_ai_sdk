# Expiry Date Extraction

## Application: Overview
This application is designed to extract expiry date information from the food items or medicines. 

The application was made to extract year, month and day from certain YYMMDD formats. 
Extracted date formats from 

"DD-MMM-YY",
"YY-MMM-DD",
"MMM-DD-YY",
"YYYY-MMM-DD",
"DD-MMM-YYYY",
"DDst-MMM-YYYY",
"MMM-DD-YYYY" 

>Note: The separator is not limited to "-", it could be any special character like [`@`,`,`,`-`,`.`,` `, `/`].  

This software caters to the needs of managers and users in diverse environments like retail and healthcare, where verifying product expiry dates is crucial.

There are 4 classes for object detection.
- Date : Expiry date
- Code : Product code if any 
- Prod : Production tag 
- Due : Due date tag

It has following mode of running.
  - Using MIPI Camera as input (RZ/V2L EVK only)
  - Using USB Camera as input
  - Using Image as input


### Supported Product
- RZ/V2L Evaluation Board Kit (RZ/V2L EVK)
- RZ/V2H Evaluation Board Kit (RZ/V2H EVK)

## Application: Build Stage

>**Note:** User can skip to the [next stage (deploy)](#application-deploy-stage) if they do not want to build the application.  
All pre-built binaries are provided.

### Prerequisites
This section expects the user to have completed Step 5 of [Getting Started Guide](https://renesas-rz.github.io/rzv_ai_sdk/latest/getting_started.html) provided by Renesas. 

After completion of the guide, the user is expected of following things.
- AI SDK setup is done.
- Following docker container is running on the host machine.
    |Board | Docker container |
    |:---|:---|
    |RZ/V2L EVK|`rzv2l_ai_sdk_container`  |
    |RZ/V2H EVK|`rzv2h_ai_sdk_container`  |

    >**Note:** Docker environment is required for building the sample application. 


### Application File Generation
1. On your host machine, copy the repository from the GitHub to the desired location. 
    1. It is recommended to copy/clone the repository on the `data` folder, which is mounted on the Docker container. 
    ```sh
    cd <path_to_data_folder_on_host>/data
    git clone https://github.com/renesas-rz/rzv_ai_sdk.git
    ```
    >Note: This command will download the whole repository, which include all other applications.  
    If you have already downloaded the repository of the same version, you may not need to run this command.  

2. Run (or start) the docker container and open the bash terminal on the container.  
E.g., for RZ/V2L, use the `rzv2l_ai_sdk_container` as the name of container created from  `rzv2l_ai_sdk_image` docker image.  
    > Note that all the build steps/commands listed below are executed on the docker container bash terminal.  

3. Set your clone directory to the environment variable.  
    ```sh
    export PROJECT_PATH=/drp-ai_tvm/data/rzv_ai_sdk
    ```
4. Go to the application source code directory.  
    ```sh
    cd ${PROJECT_PATH}/Q06_expiry_date_detection/<SRC_DIR>
    ```
    |Board | `SRC_DIR` |
    |:---|:---|
    |RZ/V2L EVK|`src`  |
    |RZ/V2H EVK|`src_v2h`  |

5. Download the `boost` tar file
   ```sh
   wget https://boostorg.jfrog.io/artifactory/main/release/1.81.0/source/boost_1_81_0.tar.bz2
   ```
   >**Note:** It is expected that the docker container is able to connect to the internet. If that's not the case, User can use the same command on the host PC to download the file. Make sure you are on the <SRC_DIR> folder present on the mounted `data` directory.

6. Extract tar file to the current location 
   ```sh
   tar -xvf boost_1_81_0.tar.bz2
   ```

7. Copy the boost files to the `include` folder 

    ```sh
    mkdir -p include
    cp -r boost_1_81_0 include/boost
    ```
8. Remove boost files [Optional]

    ```sh
    rm boost_1_81_0.tar.bz2
    rm -rf boost_1_81_0
    ```

9. [For RZ/V2L only, Optional] For USB Camera Application, comment out [`#define INPUT_CORAL`](./src/camera_mode/define.h#L78) at `./src/camera_mode/define.h`
    ```
    // #define INPUT_CORAL
    ```

10. Create and move to the `build` directory.
    ```sh
    mkdir -p build && cd build
    ```
11. Build the application by following the commands below.  
    - For RZ/V2L
      - camera input
      ```sh
      cmake -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=./toolchain/runtime.cmake ..
      make -j$(nproc) data_extraction_cam
      ```
      - image input
      ```sh
      cmake -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=./toolchain/runtime.cmake ..
      make -j$(nproc) data_extraction_img
      ```
    - For RZ/V2H
      ```sh
      cmake -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=./toolchain/runtime.cmake ..
      make -j$(nproc)
      ```
12. The following application file would be generated in the `${PROJECT_PATH}/Q06_expiry_date_detection/<SRC_DIR>/build` directory
    - date_extraction*

### Instruction
1. [FOR RZ/V2H only] Run following commands to download the necessary file.  
    ```sh
     cd <path_to_data_folder_on_host>/rzv_ai_sdk/Q06_expiry_date_detection/exe_v2h/expiry_yolov3_onnx/
     wget https://github.com/renesas-rz/rzv_ai_sdk/releases/download/v4.00/Q06_expiry_date_detection_deploy_tvm_v2h-v221.so
    ```
    
2. [FOR RZ/V2H only] Rename the `Q06_expiry_date_detection_deploy_*.so` to `deploy.so`.
    ```sh
    mv Q06_expiry_date_detection_deploy_*.so deploy.so
    ```
3. Copy the following files to the `/home/root/tvm` directory of the rootfs (SD Card) for the board.
    |File | Details |
    |:---|:---|
    |All files in `EXE_DIR` directory | Including `deploy.so` file. |
    |`date_extraction` application file | Generated the file according to [Application File Generation](#application-file-generation) |

4. Check if `libtvm_runtime.so` exists under `/usr/lib64` directory of the rootfs (SD card) on the board.

5. Folder structure in the rootfs (SD Card) would look like:
    ```
    |-- usr
    |   `-- lib64
    |       `-- libtvm_runtime.so
    `-- home
        `-- root
            `-- tvm
                |-- date_detection_tinyyolov3   #RZ/V2L only
                |   |-- deploy.json             #RZ/V2L only
                |   |-- deploy.params           #RZ/V2L only
                |   `-- deploy.so               #RZ/V2L only
                |-- expiry_yolov3_onnx          #RZ/V2H only
                |   |-- deploy.json             #RZ/V2H only
                |   |-- deploy.params           #RZ/V2H only
                |   `-- deploy.so               #RZ/V2H only
                |-- date_class_labels.txt
                |-- date_extraction_cam         #RZ/V2L only
                |-- date_extraction_img         #RZ/V2L only
                |-- date_extraction_usb         #RZ/V2L only
                |-- date_extraction
                `-- sample_img.jpg
    ```
>**Note:** The directory name could be anything instead of `tvm`. If you copy the whole `EXE_DIR` folder on the board, you are not required to rename it `tvm`.
